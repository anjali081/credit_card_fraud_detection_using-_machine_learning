# credit_card_fraud_detection_using-_machine_learning
The dataset for the analysis has been taken from Kaggle provided by Machine Learning Group-ULB. The dataset consists of 284807 credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.The dataset consists of 30 feature variables and class variable.The features V1,V2,V3,....,V28 are the principal components obtained through PCA transformation.The features ‘Time’ and ‘Amount’ have not been transformed through PCA transformation.The original features V1,V2,....V28 have not been provided by the ULB Machine Learning group due to confidentiality issues.The feature ‘Time’ denotes the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.The feature ‘Amount’ denotes the transaction amount which can be used for cost sensitive learning.’Class’ represents the target variable which is 0 for non fraudulent transactions and 1 for fraudulent transactions.
The dataset consists of 492 fraud transactions out of total 284807 transactions which makes the dataset highly imbalanced.Imbalanced datasets are the datasets which consists of unequal distribution of classes within the datase
In this project I have used NearMiss as an undersampling algorithm and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE) as an oversampling algorithm to tackle class imbalance problem.I have used ROC-AUC score as an evaluation metrics.I have used the following supervised machine learning models : Linear Regression , Logistic Regression , Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees,Neural Networks.I have also tried to use the following unsupervised machine learning models: K Means Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models.I have used Silhouette Score as an evaluation metric for unsupervised machine learning models.
